# My JavaScript Solutions for Codility Questions

This repository contains my JavaScript solutions for Codility questions.

## Prerequisites

`nvm` (Node Version Manager) is required to manage Node.js versions. You can install it by following the instructions in the [nvm repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

The Node.js version is specified in the `.nvmrc` file in this repository.  It should match with the version used by Codility platform.

## Get started

1. `nvm use` to install Node.js based on the `.nvmrc` file.
2. `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Use either one of the following commands to run the tests:
   - `npm run test` to run all tests.
   - `npm run test:watch` to run tests in watch mode.
   - `npm run test:coverage` to run tests with coverage report.
